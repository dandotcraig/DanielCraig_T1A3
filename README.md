### Provide a link to your source control repository

---

Git repository can be viewed here: https://github.com/dandotcraig/DanielCraig_T1A3


# R5	
### Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to. Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.

---

I've decided to go with the PEP8 styling convention. These are the guides I followed: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/ &  https://pep8.org/

Throughout the project I:
* Never used I, O or single letters as names
* Used underscores to between words if the variable had more than one word within it.
* Aimed to keep max line length at 79 characters 
* Followed the line indentation line break rules
* Only used blank lines inbetween to symbolise a new step
* I updated comments to match the code that had been updated while keeping them short and sweet.
* Avoided white space
* Put once space between various operators

# R6	
### Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- Loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient 

---

Tutor approval:
![Alt text](img/tutorapproval.png)

The app has six features:
* View the current workout plan on home creen
* Add a new exercise to the current workout
* Update an exercise in the current workout
* Remove an exercise from the current workout
* View your workout history/workout log since beginning to use the app - this saves workouts with date and time above.
* exit and log your workout in the history/log to be recalled at anytime.

# R7	
### Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item
- Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images that demonstrates your usage of a project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 

Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

---

For each feature - I used a different card, some cards had checklists for each item I needed to remember, but as a 'solo project manager' I found this to be an easier method, rather than hiding all the things I needed to do within a card.

# R8	
### Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application

---

### Steps

I have developed a script called [Run](run.sh), and it is designed to be opened within the terminal. First, the user must have navigated to the file of the run (hint - On Mac, the user can drag the file from Finder into the terminal, press enter, and the user will be within the required file). Then, you need to type 'bash run.sh' and enter. The file should then go through, open in a virtual environment, install the required packages, and then open the program.

Simply put:
* On Mac, drag the app's file into terminal to insure the user in within the folder structure.
* Type:
```bash
bash run.sh
```
* Press enter
* The app should now be opem, and the user is presented with 5 options.
* If it is the user first time, they will need to start to add workouts to their list, they can do this by entering 1 and following the prompts.

### Dependencies

Attached is a requirements.txt, which has the following requirements and dependencies to run the app:
* DateTime==5.4
* emoji==2.9.0
* iniconfig==2.0.0
* markdown-it-py==3.0.0

* Pygments==2.17.2
* pytest==7.4.3
* pytz==2023.3.post1
* rich==13.7.0
* zope.interface==6.1

### System and hardware requirements:

Python requirements:
* Python 3.7 or newer

Package requirements:
* Datetime (version 5.4)
* emoji (version 2.9.0)
* Rich (version 13.7.0)
