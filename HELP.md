# Help Guide

### Steps to getting started!

I have developed a script called [Run](run.sh), and it is designed to be opened within the terminal. First, the user must have navigated to the file of the run (hint - On Mac, the user can drag the file from Finder into the terminal, press enter, and the user will be within the required file). Then, you need to type 'bash run.sh' and enter. The file should then go through, open in a virtual environment, install the required packages, and then open the program.

Simply put:
* On Mac, drag the app's file into terminal to insure the user in within the folder structure.
* Type:
```bash
bash run.sh
```
* Press enter
* The app should now be opem, and the user is presented with 5 options.
* If it is the user first time, they will need to start to add workouts to their list, they can do this by entering 1 and following the prompts.
